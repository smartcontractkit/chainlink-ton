# Chainlink TON Smart Contracts

This repository includes many contracts for the TON network implemented in the [Tact](https://docs.tact-lang.org/) programming language. The source code for the contracts and their respective unit tests can be found in the  [contracts](../../contracts/) directory at the root of the repo. Contracts are tested using auto-generated Typescript wrappers and the  [Blueprint framework](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint).

## Build and Test
You must build the contracts before running the unit tests. Refer to these docs:
- [Build Chainlink TON Smart Contracts](./build.md)
- [Test Chainlink TON Smart Contracts](./test.md)
