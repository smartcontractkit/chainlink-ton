# Chainlink TON Smart Contracts

This repository includes many contracts for the TON network implemented in the [Tact](https://docs.tact-lang.org/) programming language. The source code for the contracts and their respective unit tests can be found in the  [contracts](../../contracts/) directory at the root of the repo. Contracts are built and tested using the [Blueprint framework](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint) and auto-generated Typescript wrappers.
